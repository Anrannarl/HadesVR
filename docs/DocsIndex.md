# Docs Index
Welcome to the docs Index, here you'll (hopefully) find everything you need to know about the Headset, the controllers and the driver. If there's something missing or you need help with something DM me on Discord at Liquid#4020 or email me at LiquidCGS@gmail.com.

These docs are still in a very early work-in-progress stage so don't expect everything to be here *yet*.
