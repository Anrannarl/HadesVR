The headset will not only be in charge of showing you the image and relaying back rotation data from it's internal IMU, but it will also be in charge of receiving the RF Controller data and sending it back to the computer.

Another thing that can be integrated into the headset is an USB Sound Card, that way it'll also have an integrated Microphone and a headphone jack for you to plug your headphones in. Though it's not mandatory.

As of right now, the communication between Headset and PC is done using a Serial port but this is subject to change in the future in favour of USB HID.
